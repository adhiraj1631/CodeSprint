    "Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "During the annual city parade, children line up in a single row, each wearing a numbered badge. The parade organizer wants to find the child who is standing in the middle of the line to lead the next section of the parade.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a singly linked list of badge numbers representing the lineup of children. Your task is to return a list of badge numbers starting from the chosen leader to the end of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of children is odd, the middle child is selected. If the number of children is even, the second of the two middle children is selected.\n",

    "Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "A singly linked list of integers representing badge numbers, in the order children are standing\n",
    " Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of integers representing badge numbers, starting from the selected leader (middle child) to the end of the line.\n",
