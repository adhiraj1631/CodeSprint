    "\n",
    "In the ancient kingdom of Westeros, winter is coming! To keep every villager safe and warm, the king has ordered you, the royal engineer, to design a standard heater system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each heater has a fixed warm radius R. Your task is to determine the smallest possible radius R such that every house is within the warm range of at least one heater.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "The positions of all houses on a straight road.\n",
    "\n",
    "The positions of all heaters on the same road.\n",
    "\n",
    "A house is considered \"warmed\" if the distance between it and at least one heater is less than or equal to R.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "houses: List of integers representing the positions of the houses.\n",

    "heaters: List of integers representing the positions of the heaters.\n",
