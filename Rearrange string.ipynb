    "\n",
    "In the village of Jamua from Jharkhand, festival organizers want to create a vibrant banner using a string of letters. However, to make it visually appealing, no two identical letters can be placed next to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string s of lowercase English letters representing the initial design. Your task is to rearrange the letters so that no two adjacent letters are the same. If it is possible to rearrange the string to meet this requirement, return any valid arrangement. If it's not possible, return an empty string (\"\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "A single string s consisting of lowercase English letters.\n",

    "A string representing any valid rearrangement of s such that no two adjacent characters are the same.\n",

    "The string has two 'a's and one 'b'.\n",
